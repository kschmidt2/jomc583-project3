This is a data visualization created using d3.js. It shows the number of strikeouts in Major League Baseball since the last expansion in 1998 as well as the average fastball velocity since 2002 (the earliest the data is available). It is my first d3 project and was created to begin learning d3 for an advanced interactive programming class at the University of North Carolina.
